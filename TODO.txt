* Try multiple models with different complexity and normalization
* See how accuracy scales with model complexity
* See how accuracy scales with training time (epochs)
* See how accuracy scales with training data
* Look at the input pixel data and see if we can spot any correlation
* Try with and without balancing the classes
* Try with both sigmoid and softmax
* Have some utility functions so we can deal with all these differences
* Try preexisting models with and without transfer learning
